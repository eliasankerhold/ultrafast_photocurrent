# ultrafast_photocurrent

A Python framework to simulate carrier dynamics in two-dimensional TMDC heterostructures and investigate excitonic lifetimes in MoS2/MoSe2 samples. 

Combined with experimental results, this code was used to investigate the validity of an electron-hole model as published in [Probing the Formation of Dark Interlayer Excitons via Ultrafast Photocurrent](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.3c01708).
